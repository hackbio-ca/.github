The [Toronto Bioinformatics Hackathon](https://hackbio.ca) is a student-led computational biology hackathon, bringing together early career bioinformaticians, molecular biologists, statisticians, and computer scientists from Torontoâ€™s Discovery District to complete interdisciplinary projects that emphasize computational and entrepreneurial thinking.

In partnership with the [Terrence Donnelly Centre](https://thedonnellycentre.utoronto.ca/) and the Temerty Faculty of Medicine's [Computational Biology in Molecular Genetics](https://moleculargenetics.utoronto.ca/cbmg) program, our participants will collaborate to propose innovative solutions to key challenges in computational biology with commercialization potential.
